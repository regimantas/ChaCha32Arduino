sentence=ChaCha stream cipher with 32 rounds for Arduino-compatible devices.
paragraph=Lightweight ChaCha32 implementation for Arduino and embedded devices. Based on the ChaCha stream cipher, but extended to 32 rounds for additional security. This library is designed for microcontrollers with limited resources and does not include key exchange, nonce generation, or anti-replay protection. The same algorithm is also available in C, Go, and Nim for cross-platform compatibility.
